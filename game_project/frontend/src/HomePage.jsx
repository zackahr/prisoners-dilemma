          <p className="section-text">
            These interactive games are based on classic economic experiments that reveal insights about human behavior,
            cooperation, fairness, and strategic thinking. By participating, you'll experience firsthand the dilemmas
            that have fascinated economists, psychologists, and game theorists for decades.
          </p>
          <p className="section-text">
            All games are played anonymously, and your decisions contribute to ongoing research in behavioral economics.
            Enjoy the experience and see how your strategies compare to others!
